## 🛠️ Media Club Tech Task Round

Welcome to the Tech Task Round for the ECHOES - The official Media Club of Thapar!

### 🎯 Task Objective:

Build a **one page creative personal landing webpage** that reflects **your personality, interests, and technical flair**.

This task is your opportunity to **showcase your web development skills**—from design, layout, animations, content flow, to any cool JS/CSS tricks you've picked up. Feel free to go as creative, polished, or even as experimental as you'd like.

### 📌 What You Need to Do:

1. **Fork this repository.**
2. Inside the `Submissions/` folder, create a new folder named **yourname_rollno** (e.g., `Submissions/shuchih-negi_xxxxxxxxxx`).
3. Add your HTML/CSS/JS files, assets, or frameworks inside your folder.
4. Update the `README.md` inside your folder with:

   * A short write-up on what inspired your design.
   * Any cool features/technologies/libraries you used.
   * Anything extra you want us to know!
5. **Submit a pull request** with your work before the deadline.

### 💡 Prompt:

Create a personal/portfolio-style web page that gives us a sense of:

* Who you are.
* Your visual/aesthetic/design taste.
* Your technical abilities (this can be through animations, components, or interactive elements).
* Optional: Use audio/video/typography creatively (but responsibly).

### 🍪 Cookie Points:

> You will earn extra appreciation (and possibly bonus points!) if you draw **inspiration from the website of [ECHOES](https://echoes-tiet.in/)**—our very own magazine. This could be in the form of layout choices, animations, color palette, mood, or just the storytelling style. Be tasteful, not plagiaristic!

### 🚨 Important:

**You must fork the repo first before making any changes. PRs made without forking will not be accepted.**
